# Third-Party Notices

PacificDriveHeadTracking bundles, statically links, or credits the third-party components
listed below. Each remains the property of its authors and is used under its own
licence. Where a licence requires the copyright notice, the conditions and the
disclaimer to accompany a binary distribution, the full text is reproduced here
verbatim, and this file ships at the root of every release ZIP we publish.

Nothing in this repository is derived from, or redistributes any part of,
Pacific Drive.

| Component | Version | Licence | How it ships |
|-----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| Ultimate ASI Loader | v9.7.2 | MIT | Bundled verbatim in the installer ZIP |
| MinHook | v1.3.4 | BSD-2-Clause | Compiled into `PacificDriveHeadTracking.asi` |
| cameraunlock-core | 0f7a63455ddeb91677c9268e88fd35833aa77359 | MIT | Compiled into `PacificDriveHeadTracking.asi` |
| OpenTrack | n/a | ISC | Not bundled; UDP protocol interoperability only |

## Ultimate ASI Loader

Vendored at `vendor/ultimate-asi-loader/`, shipped in the installer ZIP and used as the
install-time source. Taken from the upstream release asset untouched; the
upstream licence file ships beside it at `vendor/ultimate-asi-loader/LICENSE`.

- **Version:** v9.7.2
- **License:** MIT
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader
- **Usage:** Loads `PacificDriveHeadTracking.asi` into the game process. Vendored as `dinput8.dll` (the upstream asset's own filename) and installed as `winmm.dll` beside `PenDriverPro-Win64-Shipping.exe`.
- **Bundled:** yes. Shipped in the release ZIP and used as the install-time source; `install.cmd` extracts it from `vendor/` and never fetches it over the network.

## MinHook

Fetched from upstream at configure time and compiled into `PacificDriveHeadTracking.asi`.

- **Version:** v1.3.4
- **License:** BSD-2-Clause
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook
- **Usage:** Installs the trampoline hooks the camera, marker and reticle code needs.
- **Bundled:** no. Statically linked into `PacificDriveHeadTracking.asi`, which ships in the release ZIP; no separate MinHook file is distributed.

MinHook carries two copyright holders: Tsuda Kageyu for MinHook itself, and
Vyacheslav Patkov for the Hacker Disassembler Engine that MinHook's
`src/hde/` is built from. Both notices appear below exactly as upstream
ships them.

## OpenTrack

- **Version:** n/a (wire format only, no pinned release)
- **License:** ISC
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack
- **Usage:** The mod implements OpenTrack's UDP pose datagram layout so OpenTrack and compatible trackers can drive it.
- **Bundled:** no. No OpenTrack code, headers or binaries are copied, linked or redistributed.

Not bundled and not linked. This mod implements the OpenTrack UDP pose datagram
layout so that OpenTrack (https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack, ISC licence)
and compatible trackers can drive it. No OpenTrack code, headers or binaries
are copied, linked or redistributed, so its licence triggers no notice
obligation here. It is credited because the wire format is its work.

## Pacific Drive

Pacific Drive and all related names, logos, characters and marks are
trademarks of their respective owners. They are used here only to identify the
game this mod applies to, which is nominative use and not a claim of any right
in them. This project is an unofficial, fan-made modification. It is not
affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by the game's developers, its
publishers, its engine vendor, or any other rights holder. It redistributes no
game code, no game assets and no proprietary DLLs, and it requires a
legitimately purchased copy of the game. Any engine structure offsets,
function addresses or byte patterns referenced in the source were derived by
the authors through independent analysis of a legitimately owned copy. They
are factual measurements recorded as numbers; no decompiled or disassembled
game code is stored in this repository.
